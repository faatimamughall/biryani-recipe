<li>Step 1 for making beef biryani is marinating the beef.Cut beef into medium pieces and marinate it with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric, red chili powder, coriander powder, garam masala or biryani masala, salt, and a little oil. Mix well so the spices coat the meat evenly. Let it rest for at least 1 hour (longer—up to overnight—makes the beef more tender and flavorful).</li>
<li>Step 2 is cooking the marinated beef until tender.Transfer the marinated beef to a heavy pot or pressure cooker. Add a little water if needed, then cook on medium heat until the beef becomes soft and fully tender.</li>
<li>Step 3 is preparing and partially cooking the rice.Wash and soak basmati rice for 20–30 minutes. In a separate pot, boil water with whole spices like bay leaves, cloves, cardamom, and cinnamon, along with a little salt. Add the soaked rice and cook it until it is 70% done—the grains should be firm and not fully soft. Drain the rice and set it aside for layering.</li>
<li>Step 4 for beef biryani is layering the rice and beef.In a heavy-bottomed pot, first spread a layer of the cooked beef along with its gravy. Then gently layer the partially cooked rice over the beef. Sprinkle fried onions, chopped mint, chopped cilantro, and saffron-soaked milk (or a little colored milk) on top. You can also drizzle some ghee to enhance the aroma. This layering ensures that the rice absorbs the flavors from the beef and spices during the final cooking.</li>
<li>Step 5 is cooking the biryani on dum (slow steaming).After layering, seal the pot tightly with a lid or dough to trap the steam. Cook on very low heat for 25–30 minutes, allowing the rice to fully cook and absorb the flavors of the beef and spices. This slow steaming, or “dum,” gives the biryani its signature aroma and taste.</li>
<li>Step 6 is serving the beef biryani.Once the dum cooking is complete, let the biryani rest for a few minutes. Gently fluff the rice to mix it with the beef without breaking the grains. Serve hot with raita, salad, boiled eggs, or pickles for a complete and flavorful meal.</li>

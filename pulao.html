<li>Step 1 for making pulao is preparing the rice and ingredients.Wash basmati rice thoroughly and soak it in water for about 20–30 minutes. Meanwhile, chop your choice of vegetables (like carrots, beans, peas, and capsicum) or meat if making a non-vegetarian pulao. Gather whole spices such as bay leaves, cloves, cardamom, and cinnamon for tempering. This preparation ensures a smooth cooking process for flavorful pulao.</li>
<li>Step 2 is tempering the spices and sautéing the ingredients.Heat oil or ghee in a heavy-bottomed pot. Add whole spices like bay leaves, cloves, cardamom, and cinnamon, and sauté for a few seconds until fragrant. Then add sliced onions and sauté until golden brown. If using garlic or ginger, add them now and cook until the raw smell disappears. For a non-vegetarian version, add meat at this stage and sauté until lightly browned.</li>
<li>Step 3 is adding vegetables and/or meat with spices.Add the chopped vegetables (like carrots, beans, peas, or capsicum) to the pot and sauté for a few minutes. If making a non-vegetarian pulao, ensure the meat is partially cooked at this stage. Then add ground spices such as turmeric, red chili powder, coriander powder, and salt. Mix well so that the vegetables and/or meat are evenly coated with the spices.</li>
<li>Step 4 is adding the soaked rice and water.Drain the soaked basmati rice and gently add it to the pot, mixing lightly with the vegetables or meat and spices. Pour in water—usually 1.5 to 2 cups of water for every cup of rice—and adjust salt as needed. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil before reducing the heat to simmer.</li>
<li>Step 5 is cooking the pulao on low heat.Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and cook on low heat for 15–20 minutes, or until the rice is fully cooked and all the water is absorbed. Avoid stirring too much to keep the rice grains intact and fluffy. Once done, turn off the heat and let the pulao rest for a few minutes before serving.</li>
<li>Step 6 is serving the pulao.Gently fluff the rice with a fork to separate the grains without breaking them. Serve the pulao hot, garnished with fried onions, chopped cilantro, or mint if desired. It pairs well with raita, salad, or a simple curry for a complete meal.</li>

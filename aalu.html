<li>Step 1 for making aloo (potato) biryani is preparing the potatoes.Peel and cut potatoes into medium-sized cubes. Parboil or shallow-fry them until they are just cooked but still firm. This ensures they hold their shape during the biryani cooking. Set the potatoes aside for layering later.</li>
<li>Step 2 is preparing the rice.Wash and soak basmati rice for 20–30 minutes. In a pot, boil water with whole spices like bay leaves, cloves, cardamom, and cinnamon, plus a little salt. Add the soaked rice and cook it until it is about 70% done—the grains should still be firm. Drain the rice and set it aside for layering.</li>
<li>Step 3 is preparing the biryani masala base.Heat oil or ghee in a heavy-bottomed pot. Sauté sliced onions until golden brown, then add ginger-garlic paste and cook until the raw smell disappears. Add chopped tomatoes, green chilies, turmeric, red chili powder, coriander powder, garam masala, and salt. Cook until the oil separates from the masala, creating a flavorful base for the potatoes and rice.</li>
<li>Step 4 is layering the biryani.In the pot with the prepared masala, add the par-cooked or fried potatoes and gently mix to coat them with the spices. Then spread the partially cooked rice evenly over the potato mixture. Sprinkle fried onions, chopped mint, chopped cilantro, and saffron-soaked milk (or a little colored milk) on top. Drizzle some ghee for extra aroma. This layering allows the rice to absorb the flavors during dum cooking.</li>
<li>Step 5 is cooking the aloo biryani on dum (slow steaming).Cover the pot tightly with a lid or seal it with dough to trap the steam. Cook on very low heat for 20–25 minutes, allowing the rice to fully cook and absorb the flavors from the potatoes, spices, and herbs. Avoid opening the lid during this time to preserve the aroma and texture.</li>
<li>Step 6 is serving the aloo biryani.Once the dum cooking is complete, let the biryani rest for a few minutes. Gently fluff the rice and potatoes to mix without breaking the grains. Serve hot with raita, yogurt, salad, or pickle for a delicious and comforting meal.</li>

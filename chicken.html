    <h1>chicken biryani recipe</h1> 

<li>Step 1 in making chicken biryani is marinating the chicken.To do this, mix chicken pieces with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric, red chili powder, garam masala or biryani masala, salt, lemon juice, and a little oil. Coat the chicken well and let it marinate for at least 30 minutes (longer gives better flavor).</li>
<li>Step 2 is preparing and partially cooking the rice.Rinse basmati rice well and soak it for 20–30 minutes. Then boil water with whole spices like bay leaves, cardamom, cloves, and a cinnamon stick, along with a little salt. Add the soaked rice and cook it until it is about 70% done—the grains should still have a slight bite. Drain the rice and set it aside for layering.</li>
<li>Step 3 is cooking the marinated chicken.Heat ghee or oil in a heavy-bottomed pot and add the marinated chicken. Cook it on medium heat until the chicken starts releasing its juices and is partially cooked. This creates the flavorful base over which the rice will be layered.</li>
<li>Step 3 is layering the biryani.Spread the partially cooked rice evenly over the chicken in the pot. Then sprinkle fried onions, chopped mint, chopped cilantro, and saffron-soaked milk (or colored milk) on top. You can also drizzle a little ghee for extra aroma and richness. This layered setup is what gives biryani its signature flavor.</li>
<li>Step 4 is cooking the biryani on dum (slow steam cooking).Seal the pot with a tight lid (you can use dough or a heavy lid to trap steam) and cook on low heat for about 20–25 minutes. This allows the flavors to blend, the chicken to finish cooking, and the rice to become fully fluffy and aromatic. Once done, gently fluff and serve hot.</li>
<li>Step 5 is serving the biryani.Once the dum cooking is complete, let the biryani rest for a few minutes, then gently fluff it from the sides to avoid breaking the rice grains. Serve it hot with raita, salad, boiled eggs, or pickle for a complete and delicious meal. Enjoy!</li>
